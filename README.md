## Experience

### Mastercard | Applied AI Scientist | New York, NY | Sep 2024 to Dec 2024
- Built a Web Scraping and Ingestion pipeline for 10,000 URLs using BeautifulSoup with a Selenium fallback.
- Benchmarked Multilingual Translators across 35 languages and productionized the best option, reducing processing time from 4 weeks to 3 hours.
- Delivered cost-efficient Website Categorization using LLMs and Synonym-Aware Precision@3 evaluation, reducing run cost from $46 to $2.30 per 10,000 URLs with a 16 to 20 minute runtime using concurrency.

### Columbia Climate School | Data Scientist | New York, NY | Sep 2024 to Dec 2024
- Developed a Streamlit RAG application for researchers to query multiple documents with source-grounded responses.
- Reduced turnaround time by 84% by chunking, embedding, and retrieving only top evidence per query instead of sending full reports, lowering token cost.
- Improved an existing CNN using stacked kernels, BatchNorm, Dropout, and EarlyStopping, increasing accuracy by 8% and reducing training time by about 15%.

### BlocPower | Data Scientist | Brooklyn, NY | May 2024 to Aug 2024
- Validated 120M+ records in Amazon Redshift and reduced data inconsistencies by 34% to improve data quality.
- Developed supervised ML models in AWS (S3, SageMaker) to predict building energy characteristics supporting decarbonization.
- Integrated MLflow into a production MLOps workflow with CI/CD for automated retraining, validation, and deployment, enabling assessments that helped reduce energy waste by up to 80%.
- Created performance monitoring reports for cross-functional teams, translating model outputs into actionable business metrics.

### Columbia Engineering | Machine Learning Research Assistant | New York, NY | Sep 2023 to Apr 2024
- Reduced Teaching Assistants' workload by 50% by building an LLM assistant to answer repetitive student questions.
- Implemented semantic retrieval using a LangChain LLM plus RAG pipeline over an Excel knowledge base with embeddings and a vector database.
- Improved answer reliability with a strict context-only prompt and an "I do not know" fallback, deployed in Streamlit with an admin reindex workflow.
- Built Tableau dashboards from 100,000 public health records across 30 years to connect demographic and social factors to lifestyle outcomes.

### Gonit Shikkha Kendro | Data Science Instructor | Dhaka, Bangladesh | Jun 2022 to Aug 2023
- Taught data preparation for ML, DL, and NLP using Python, SQL, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, spaCy, and NLTK.
- Designed and led workshops on data storytelling, critical thinking, and strategy development for real-world data problems.

### SRM Institute of Science and Technology | Deep Learning Research Assistant | Chennai, India | Jun 2021 to May 2022
- Improved Mask R-CNN on satellite imagery by optimizing the ResNet backbone and tuning hyperparameters.
- Achieved 82% object detection accuracy for small-object recognition and published results with Springer.
